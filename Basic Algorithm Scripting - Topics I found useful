// Introduction to Basic Algorithm Scripting
// A computer algorithm is a sequence of steps that is followed to achieve a particular outcome. To write an algorithm, you must first understand a problem, and then solve it with coding.

// To make solving problems eaiser, it can be helpful to break them down into many chuncks. Then, each chunk can be solved one by one. For example, if you are building a calculator, don't try to solve the problem as a whole. First, consider how to get inputs. Then, determine each arithematic operation one by one. Finally, display the results.

// In this section we will learn to solve basic algorithm problems using JavaScript. This will help you improve your problem solving skills and prepare you to later solve more complex problems.

// Hint
// If you get stuck, try using console.log() to log variable values to the console. This will help to debug problems.

// Basic Algorithm Scripting: Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit

// The algorithm to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the temperature in Celsius times 9/5, plus 32.

// Q. Convert celsius to fahrenheit

// A.
function convertToF(celsius) {
  let fahrenheit;
  fahrenheit = celsius * 9/5 + 32;
  return fahrenheit;
}

convertToF(30);
// => 86
